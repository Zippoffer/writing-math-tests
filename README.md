User Interface

Create a user interface for a calculator. One text input and 6 buttons.
The user will enter a number in the text input.
The user will then press one of the buttons for an operation.
The input field should be cleared so that a new number can be typed in.
The user will then type in a new number and press enter.
The resulting value of the operation should then be in the text input.
